## Getting Started

* Youâ€™ll need a Kubernetes to run against. 
  * kube-dns service is exposed
  * It is recommended to switch the current context to the kube-system

### Go 1.20
The project is done using go1.20.

Install.
```sh
# install go.120
go install golang.org/dl/go1.20@latest
GOPATH=`go env GOPATH`
$GOPATH/bin/go1.20 download

# export 
export GOROOT=`$(go env GOPATH)/bin/go1.20 env GOROOT`
export PATH=${GOROOT}/bin:${PATH}

# check version
go version
```



### Running on the cluster
1. Install Instances of Custom Resources:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

2. Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/coredns-manager-operator:tag
```

3. Update namespace if needed in `config/default/kustomization.yaml`. Operator shall be installed in the same namespace as your coredns. 
   
4. Deploy the controller to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:

   ```sh
   make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/coredns-manager-operator:tag
   ```
   OR, Alternatively, generate manifests using kustomize.
   ```sh
    make installation-manifests IMG=<some-registry>/coredns-manager-operator:tag
    kubectl apply -f deploy/operator.yaml
    ```


### Uninstall CRDs
To delete the CRDs from the cluster:

```sh
make uninstall
```

### Undeploy controller
UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:

```sh
make undeploy
```

### How it works
This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out
1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:
   ```sh
   make install
   ```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):
   ```sh
   make run
   ```

   **NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

   **NOTE:** You can also run `make from-scratch` to run all together: recreate kind cluster, set kube-system as current context, generate, manifests, install and run.

#### Manual test
Since the project does not have unit tests yet, it is recommended to follow the manual QA guide to ensure the quality of the controller.
[Manual QA Guide](qa/dev-manual-qa-guide.md)

### Modifying the API definitions
If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets
